Here’s a **tight 5-screen workflow journey** — optimized for **Varun Mayya–style explainers** and **human-in-the-loop control**, not gimmicks.

---

## **Screen 1 — Idea → Intent Lock**

**Goal:** Convert raw idea into a clear editorial intent.

**UI**

* Big input box:
  *“What’s the idea you want to explain?”*
* Optional toggles:

  * Tone: Insightful / Contrarian / Calm explainer
  * Audience: Builders / General / India-first
  * Length: 30s / 45s / 60s

**Output**

* One-line **Intent Statement**
  (“Explain why X is happening and why it matters”)

**Eval**

* Human confirms: *“Yes, this is what I want to say.”*

---

## **Screen 2 — Evidence & Proof Builder**

**Goal:** Ground the idea in reality (this is why Varun videos feel credible).

**UI**

* Upload / auto-fetch:

  * Video clips
  * Screenshots
  * Tweets
  * Articles
* Timeline preview showing:

  * Where proof will appear
  * What will be highlighted

**Output**

* Ordered **Proof Stack**
  (Source → Key line → Visual highlight)

**Eval**

* Human rates: *Credibility 1–5*
* Can remove weak proofs

---

## **Screen 3 — Script + Beat Map**

**Goal:** Lock narration + pacing.

**UI**

* Left: Script (editable)
* Right: Beat map timeline:

  * Hook (0–3s)
  * Context (3–10s)
  * Insight (10–25s)
  * Implication (25–40s)
  * Close (40–60s)

**Controls**

* “Make it tighter”
* “More emotional”
* “More neutral”

**Output**

* Final narration script
* Scene-by-scene breakdown

**Eval**

* Human scores:

  * Clarity
  * Flow
  * Confidence

---

## **Screen 4 — Visual Assembly Preview**

**Goal:** Turn script into actual video language.

**UI**

* Low-res preview render:

  * Avatar / host
  * PIP proof highlights
  * Captions & typography
  * Transitions
* Per-scene controls:

  * Font style
  * Emphasis words
  * Zoom / pan / cut

**Output**

* Locked **Visual Blueprint**
  (No final render yet)

**Eval**

* Scene-level approve / reject
* Notes per scene

---

## **Screen 5 — Final Render & Publish**

**Goal:** Ship.

**UI**

* Final HD render
* Auto-generated:

  * YouTube title
  * Description
  * Hashtags
* Export buttons:

  * YouTube Shorts
  * Instagram Reels

**Eval**

* Final rating
* “Ship / Iterate”
* Feedback saved for future runs

---

## Why this works

* No prompt dumping
* Proof first, visuals second
* Human approves at **meaningful choke points**
* Feels like a **studio**, not a toy

---

If you want next, I can:

* map each screen → exact agents involved
* define eval schema per screen
* design MVP vs Pro feature split

**Q1**

**How do I design Screen 2 so proof feels discovered, not forced?**

**Q2**

**Which screen should be mandatory vs skippable for power users?**

**Q3**

**How do I reuse Screen 2 + 3 to create multiple videos from one idea?**
